Hitaeshi Sehgal — Technical Portfolio

Computer Science student focused on AI systems, automation architecture, and data-driven decision design.

My work centers around building modular, scalable systems rather than isolated scripts.

1. Lead Automation Suite (n8n)

Repository:
https://github.com/littlemissmuffins/n8n-lead-automation-suite

Designed and implemented a modular LeadOps automation system with:

Webhook-based lead ingestion

AI-assisted lead qualification logic

Conditional routing for high-priority emails

Gmail API notifications

Google Sheets structured logging

Modular workflow orchestration

What this demonstrates:

Automation architecture

API integration

Workflow modularity

Scalable system design thinking

2. AI Agent Experiments

Repository:
https://github.com/littlemissmuffins/GENAI-AI-AGENTS--WIT

Includes:

LLM-based PDF summarization

Autonomous crawler prototype

Agent workflow experimentation

What this demonstrates:

LLM integration

Prompt engineering

Early-stage agent system design

3. Data Analysis — Credit Risk Study

Repository:
https://github.com/littlemissmuffins/project-1

Performed structured analysis on credit risk dataset.

What this demonstrates:

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Structured dataset interpretation

Focus Areas

Automation Systems

AI & LLM Workflows

Data-Driven Decision Systems

Scalable Technical Architecture
